    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Tartare is a dish that originates from France, commonly made of raw tenderloin, minced into small pieces, mixed in with capers, mustard, worcestershire, pickles, and topped with a raw egg.</p>
<p>This version uses Korean flavors, replacing the bold ones from mustard and pickles with apples and Korean chili paste. It's not traditional in any way but it's really good!</p>
    
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g raw tenderloin</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp gochujang</li>
        <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chili oil</li>
        <li>Half a green apple, julienned</li>
        <li>Half a cucumber, julienned</li>
        <li>3 small radishes, julienned</li>
        <li>1 spring onion, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>

    </ul>
  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the beef tenderloin into small pieces, almost into a mince, but not into a paste. This will take some strength.</li>
        <li>Add all the sauce ingredients into a bowl, starting from sesame oil to the chili oil, and mix them well.</li>
        <li>Mix the sauce in the beef, along with the julienned radishes, apples, and cucumber, and incorporate well.</li>
        <li>Plate in the center of a plate, and top with the raw egg yolk, some spring onion slices, and a spoon of chili oil.</li>
        <li>Serve with a side plate of rice, or on top of warm toasted sourdough bread.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
